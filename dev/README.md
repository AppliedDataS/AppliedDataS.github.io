# Multi-variant-calculus
Several examples of Jacobian and Hessian matrix gneration using sympy python library

The examples are from the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) course [Multivariate Calculus for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning/home/week/2)
by Dr. Sam Cooper form the Imperial College London.

The code focuses on generating the solutions in latex format
