# Coding Journey
I have a memory problem. so I decided to record various problems and their solutions. I like to code/hack a lot so the topics will vary depending on the problem and how I solve it. see what I am up to [here](index.html)



1. Create a TXT record in your DNS configuration for the following hostname: _github-pages-challenge-AppliedDataS.ds-coding-it.co.uk
2. Use this code for the value of the TXT record: eb53f825bff2dacf0380b80b481506
3. Wait until your DNS configuration changes. This could take up to 24 hours to propagate.
